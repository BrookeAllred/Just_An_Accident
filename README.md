This repo contains the jupyter notebook for the group project

You will need to download the data from kaggle by following this link
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data

You will want to place the .csv files in the same folder as the notebook.

Don't commit the csv files... Github gets mad when that happens haha
